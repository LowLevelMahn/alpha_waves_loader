1. Download the tools - all open source and free, all tools can just be unzip (no installation needed)

just unzip - no installation needed!!

openwatcom v2: https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2/releases 
-> https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2/releases/download/Current-build/open-watcom-2_0-c-win-x64.exe

at least: Build from/after 2022-03-12 13:08:41 to have Issue 841 fixed: https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2/issues/841

2. unpack and copy the folders into the tools folder

[3. MASM/ML V9 - can be found in the VS2008 Express installation - newer releases won't work for 16bit, but still for 32bit dos]

rename the folder to match this hierarchy, no moving of single files - just the complete
folder - in the end these executables need to be reachable

tools\uasm_x64\uasm64.exe
tools\open-watcom-2_0-c-win-x64\binnt64\wlink.exe
[tools\masm\9\ml.exe]
